Some of the benefits of using AirMagnet Survey PRO are:
 
- It supports the latest Wi-Fi standards, including Wi-Fi 6E, which operates in the 6 GHz band and offers more channels and less interference.
- It enables users to perform active and passive surveys simultaneously, saving time and resources.
- It integrates with AirMagnet Planner, a predictive modeling tool that helps users plan the optimal placement and configuration of access points before deployment.
- It generates detailed reports and heatmaps that show various aspects of network performance, such as signal strength, noise, interference, coverage, capacity, throughput, and quality of service.
- It helps users troubleshoot and optimize wireless networks by identifying and resolving issues such as co-channel interference, rogue access points, misconfigured settings, and coverage gaps.

AirMagnet Survey PRO is a must-have tool for anyone who wants to design, deploy, and optimize wireless networks with confidence and efficiency. It is compatible with Windows 10 and requires a license key to activate. The latest version of AirMagnet Survey PRO is 8.2.293[^1^].

One of the key features of AirMagnet Survey PRO is the AirMapper Site Survey, which allows users to perform surveys using the AirCheck G3 or EtherScope nXG devices. These devices are handheld network testers that can connect to any Wi-Fi network and collect data on network performance and health. Users can use the AirMapper app on the devices to create floor plans, mark locations, and upload survey data to AirMagnet Survey PRO for analysis and reporting.
 
Another feature of AirMagnet Survey PRO is the spectrum analysis, which helps users identify and locate sources of interference that can degrade network performance. AirMagnet Survey PRO can integrate with AirMagnet Spectrum XT, a USB-based spectrum analyzer that can scan the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands and detect various types of interference, such as Bluetooth, microwave ovens, cordless phones, and video cameras. Users can view the spectrum data in real time or overlay it on the survey heatmaps to pinpoint the interference sources.
 
AirMagnet Survey PRO also supports voice over Wi-Fi testing, which helps users ensure that their wireless network can support high-quality voice calls. AirMagnet Survey PRO can simulate voice traffic using iPerf or a VoFi phone and measure various metrics, such as jitter, packet loss, mean opinion score (MOS), and roaming delay. Users can also use AirMagnet Voice over Wi-Fi Analyzer to perform active voice testing and troubleshoot voice issues on the network.
