Comfort Food by Kitty Thomas is a dark and provocative story that explores the psychology of captivity, Stockholm syndrome, and eroticism. It follows the journey of Emily Vargas, a successful and educated woman who is kidnapped and held prisoner by a mysterious man who calls himself Master. He wants to break her and make her his obedient pet by using various methods of conditioning and manipulation. He does not force her to do anything, but he makes her choose between unpleasant options. He does not talk to her, but he makes her crave his attention. He does not touch her, but he makes her desire his touch.
 
As Emily struggles to survive and escape, she also begins to question her own identity, sanity, and morality. She starts to feel a strange bond with her captor, a bond that is both terrifying and exhilarating. She wonders if she can ever go back to her old life, or if she has been changed forever by her ordeal.
 
Comfort Food by Kitty Thomas is not a typical romance novel. It is a dark and disturbing tale that will challenge your boundaries and make you think. It is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. It is a book that will stay with you long after you finish it.
