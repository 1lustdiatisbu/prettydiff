# How to Install Patches for The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series
 
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series is a collection of all four seasons, The Walking Dead: Michonne, and the 400 Days DLC of the acclaimed adventure game series based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman. The Definitive Series includes graphical enhancements, gameplay improvements, and exclusive behind-the-scenes content[^1^]. However, some players may encounter issues with the game's resolution, audio, or performance. In this article, we will show you how to install patches for The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series to fix these problems and enjoy the game in its best possible state.
 
## Resolution Patch
 
One of the most common issues with The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series is that it does not support ultra-widescreen resolutions (21:9 or higher) natively. The game has a static 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that it will display black bars on the sides of the screen on ultra-widescreen monitors[^3^]. To fix this issue, you can use a tool called Telltale Widescreen Patcher, which allows you to adjust the game's resolution and aspect ratio to your liking. Here are the steps to use this tool:

This can be very distracting and ruin the immersion of the game.
