The movie is directed by Renny Harlin, who is known for his action-packed movies like Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger. He does a great job of creating a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere in the underwater facility where the movie takes place. He also uses the sharks as an effective threat that are not only fast and powerful, but also smart and cunning. The movie has some impressive special effects that make the sharks look realistic and menacing. The movie also has some memorable scenes that will make you jump, scream or laugh.
 
The movie is not without its flaws, however. Some of the characters are stereotypical and underdeveloped, and some of the dialogue is cheesy and clichÃ©d. The movie also has some plot holes and inconsistencies that might bother some viewers. The movie also relies on some CGI effects that look dated and fake compared to the practical effects. The movie also has some scenes that are unrealistic and over-the-top, but they add to the fun and excitement of the movie.
 
Deep Blue Sea is a movie that does not take itself too seriously and delivers what it promises: a fun and thrilling shark tale. It is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you cheer or cringe at the same time. It is a movie that will make you appreciate the original Jaws even more, but also enjoy this one for what it is: a guilty pleasure.
