In this article, we will show you how to use IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5 to manage your network efficiently and securely.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5
 
You can download IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5 from the official website[^2^]. The installation file is about 10 MB and it does not require any additional software or drivers. You can install it on any computer that you want to use as a remote controller or a remote host.
 
After downloading the file, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose to install the program for all users or only for yourself. You can also choose the installation folder and whether to create a desktop shortcut or not.
 
## Step 2: Configure the Remote Hosts
 
Before you can remotely control a computer in your network, you need to configure it as a remote host. This means that you need to enable remote access on that computer and set a password for security.
 
To do this, run IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5 on the computer that you want to control and click on the Settings button. In the Settings window, check the box that says "Enable Remote Access". Then, enter a password of your choice in the Password field and confirm it. You can also change the port number if you want, but the default is 6129. Click OK to save the changes.
 
You can repeat this process for any other computer that you want to control remotely.
 
## Step 3: Connect to a Remote Host
 
Now that you have configured the remote hosts, you can connect to them from your remote controller computer. To do this, run IntelliAdmin Remote Control 5 on your controller computer and click on the Connect button. In the Connect window, enter the IP address or hostname of the remote host that you want to connect to and click OK.
 
You will be prompted to enter the password that you set for that remote host. After entering the correct password, you will see a window showing the remote desktop of that computer. You can use your mouse and keyboard to control it as if you were sitting in front of it.
