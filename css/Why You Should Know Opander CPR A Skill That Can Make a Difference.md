Opander CPR is a revolutionary device that combines oxygen and defibrillation to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cases of cardiac arrest. CPR is a lifesaving technique that involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to restore blood circulation and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. However, CPR alone may not be enough to revive a person who has suffered a cardiac arrest, especially if the heart rhythm is abnormal or the oxygen level is low. That's why Opander CPR offers a more effective and convenient solution.
 
## How does Opander CPR work?
 
Opander CPR is a portable device that consists of two components: an oxygen mask and a defibrillator. The oxygen mask is attached to a cylinder that delivers high-flow oxygen to the person's lungs. The defibrillator is a device that delivers an electric shock to the heart to correct an abnormal rhythm. The device can be used by anyone who has received basic training in CPR and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED).

To use Opander CPR, follow these steps:
 
1. Check if the person is responsive and breathing normally. If not, call 911 or your local emergency number and get the Opander CPR device.
2. Turn on the device and follow the voice prompts. Peel off the white pads from the grey plastic case and attach them to the person's chest as shown on the pictures.
3. Place the oxygen mask over the person's mouth and nose and secure it with the straps. Make sure there are no leaks or obstructions.
4. Start chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest, about 2 inches deep for adults and one-third the depth of the chest for children and infants.
5. The device will analyze the heart rhythm and tell you if a shock is needed. If so, make sure no one is touching the person and press the shock button when instructed.
6. Continue chest compressions and oxygen delivery until help arrives or the person shows signs of life, such as breathing, coughing, or moving.

- It provides oxygen to the lungs, which can improve survival chances and reduce brain damage.
- It delivers defibrillation, which can restore a normal heart rhythm and increase blood flow.
- It simplifies the CPR process by combining two devices into one and giving clear instructions.
- It reduces the risk of infection and fatigue for the rescuer by eliminating mouth-to-mouth contact and minimizing interruptions.

## Where can I get Opander CPR?
 
Opander CPR is currently available for purchase online at www.opandercpr.com. You can also find it at selected pharmacies, hospitals, schools, workplaces, and public places.
