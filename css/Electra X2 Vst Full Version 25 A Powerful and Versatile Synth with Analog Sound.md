## Multi-Synthesis Oscillators
 
One of the main strengths of Electra X2 Vst is its multi-synthesis oscillators, which allow you to combine up to 18 different types of synthesis per voice. You can choose from classic modes like Virtual Analog, FM, Phase Distortion, Ultrasaw, Sync and Waveshaping, as well as innovative modes like Fractal Synthesis, which can mimic the behavior of organic or analog circuits. You can also import your own samples or wavetables and use them as oscillators, or resynthesize them with a single click. Electra X2 Vst comes with a large library of waveforms and wavetables, including analog and digital types, that you can morph and modulate in various ways.
 
## Flexible Filters and Distortion
 
Each synth voice in Electra X2 Vst has two multi-mode filters with 23 unique filter types, including analog modeled filters, high precision digital filters, vocal filters, comb filters, phasers, equalizers and more. The filters can self-oscillate and produce a wide range of timbres due to the variable degree of analog behavior. You can also apply distortion to each filter with six different modes, such as tube sound, fuzzbox or waveshaping. The distortion unit can add warmth, grit or character to your sounds.
 
## Powerful Effects and Modulation
 
Electra X2 Vst has a built-in effects section with 37 professional quality effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, compressor, limiter, EQ and more. You can use up to four effects per voice and arrange them in any order. You can also modulate any parameter of the effects with the flexible modulation matrix. Electra X2 Vst has four LFOs, four envelopes and four step sequencers per voice that you can use to create dynamic and expressive sounds. You can also use external MIDI controllers or automation to control any parameter of the synth.
 
## Easy to Use Interface and Preset Management
 
Electra X2 Vst has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and tweak the synth parameters. You can access all the features from a single window or use the tabs to focus on specific sections. You can also resize the interface to fit your screen resolution. Electra X2 Vst has a preset management system that gives you instant access to a large library of sounds by professional designers.
