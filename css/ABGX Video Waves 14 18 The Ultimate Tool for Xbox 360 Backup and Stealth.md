# How to Use ABGX Video Waves 14-18 to Verify Xbox 360 Games
 
ABGX is a software tool that can check the integrity and compatibility of Xbox 360 games. It can verify if the game disc has the correct video partition, which is essential for playing on Xbox Live. ABGX can also patch the video partition with the appropriate wave file, which is a small piece of data that indicates the firmware version of the Xbox 360.
