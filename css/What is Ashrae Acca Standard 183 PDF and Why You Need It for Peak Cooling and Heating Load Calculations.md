When designing HVAC systems for buildings, one of the most important steps is to determine the peak cooling and heating loads. These are the maximum amounts of heat that need to be removed or added by the HVAC system to maintain comfortable indoor conditions. Peak cooling and heating loads depend on various factors, such as building location, orientation, envelope, occupancy, lighting, equipment, ventilation, and infiltration.
 
To help engineers perform accurate and consistent peak cooling and heating load calculations, ASHRAE and ACCA have jointly developed a standard that establishes the minimum requirements and procedures for this task. The standard is called ASHRAE/ACCA Standard 183: Peak Cooling and Heating Load Calculations in Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings. It was first published in 2007 and reaffirmed in 2017 and 2020.

The standard applies to all types of buildings except low-rise residential buildings, which are covered by a separate standard (ASHRAE Standard 152). The standard covers both steady-state and dynamic methods of calculation, as well as the use of computer software and hand calculations. The standard also provides guidance on how to select and use climatic data, design conditions, internal heat gains, ventilation and infiltration rates, and other input parameters for the calculations.
 
The standard does not prescribe a specific method or software for performing the calculations, but rather sets forth the minimum criteria that any method or software must meet to ensure accuracy and reliability. The standard also does not provide detailed instructions on how to perform the calculations, but rather refers to other sources of information, such as ASHRAE Handbook chapters, ASHRAE publications, ACCA manuals, and other industry standards.
 
The standard is intended to be used by engineers, architects, contractors, code officials, and other professionals involved in the design and construction of HVAC systems. The standard can help them achieve better energy efficiency, comfort, and indoor air quality in buildings. The standard can also serve as a basis for code compliance, quality assurance, and professional development.
 
The standard can be purchased in print or PDF format from the ASHRAE website or from other online vendors. The current price is $84 for ASHRAE members and $126 for non-members[^1^]. A read-only version of the standard can be previewed for free on the ASHRAE website[^2^].
  
In this article, we will provide a brief overview of the main sections and requirements of ASHRAE/ACCA Standard 183. The standard consists of six sections and two informative appendices. The sections are as follows:
 
- Section 1: Scope. This section defines the purpose, scope, and application of the standard. It also lists the normative references and definitions used in the standard.
- Section 2: General Requirements. This section specifies the general requirements for performing peak cooling and heating load calculations, such as the units of measurement, the level of detail, the documentation, and the quality control.
- Section 3: Climatic Data. This section provides guidance on how to select and use climatic data for the calculations, such as the design dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the solar radiation, and the wind speed and direction.
- Section 4: Building Envelope Heat Transfer. This section covers the methods and procedures for calculating the heat transfer through the building envelope, such as the walls, roofs, floors, windows, doors, and skylights. It also addresses the effects of shading, thermal mass, air films, and thermal bridges.
- Section 5: Internal Heat Gains. This section covers the methods and procedures for calculating the internal heat gains from occupants, lighting, equipment, appliances, and other sources. It also addresses the diversity factors, schedules, and load profiles.
- Section 6: Ventilation and Infiltration. This section covers the methods and procedures for calculating the ventilation and infiltration rates and loads for the building. It also addresses the effects of mechanical ventilation systems, natural ventilation, air leakage, and pressurization.

The appendices are as follows:

- Appendix A: Informative References. This appendix lists some informative references that can provide additional information and guidance on peak cooling and heating load calculations.
- Appendix B: Sample Calculation Procedure. This appendix provides a sample calculation procedure for a simple office building using a steady-state method. It shows how to apply the requirements of the standard and how to document the results.
