## What is Font Substitution?
  
Font substitution is a process that occurs when a document uses a font that is not installed on your computer.

This can affect the appearance and layout of your document, especially if the substituted font has different sizes, styles, or characters than the original one.

- **Install the missing fonts**: The easiest way to fix this error is to install the fonts that are used in the document on your computer. You can find out which fonts are missing by clicking on the "Fonts" button in the error message box. This will open a dialog box that shows you the list of fonts that are used in the document and which ones are substituted. You can then search for and download the missing fonts from the internet or copy them from another computer that has them.
- **Change the default font**: Another way to fix this error is to change the default font in Word to match the one that is used in the document. To do this, go to File > Options > Advanced > General > Web Options > Fonts and select the font that you want to use as the default for all documents. This will prevent Word from substituting fonts when opening documents that use different fonts.
- **Embed fonts in the document**: A third way to fix this error is to embed the fonts that are used in the document into the file itself. This will ensure that the document will look the same on any computer that opens it, regardless of the fonts installed on it. To do this, go to File > Save As > Tools > Save Options and check the box that says "Embed fonts in the file". Note that this will increase the file size and may not work for some fonts due to licensing restrictions.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the font substitution will occur continue error in Word and enjoy your documents without any hassle.
