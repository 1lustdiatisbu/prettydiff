However, some of the cards are very rare and hard to obtain, which can make the game frustrating for some players. If you want to get all the cards without spending hours of grinding, you can use a cheat engine to modify the game's data and get unlimited starchips, which are the currency used to buy cards.
 
A cheat engine is a software that allows you to change the values of certain variables in a game, such as health, money, or items.
