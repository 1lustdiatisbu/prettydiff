- Use a bow. The best weapon in Far Cry 3 is the bow and arrow. This is not opinion, it's just the best weapon. It's silent, it's deadly, it can one-shot most normal enemies, and it can eventually be upgraded with explosive and fire arrows. The bow is also great for hunting animals, as it preserves their skins better than guns or knives. You can get a bow for free by climbing the first radio tower, so don't miss this opportunity.
- Be a silent assassin. Stealth is your best friend in Far Cry 3, especially when you're outnumbered and outgunned by your enemies. You can use various methods to take down your foes quietly, such as knife takedowns, throwing knives, silenced weapons, or distractions. You can also use the environment to your advantage, such as hiding in bushes, underwater, or behind cover. You can also use animals to create chaos among your enemies by shooting their cages or throwing bait near them.
- Systematically take over outposts. Outposts are enemy bases that you can liberate to gain access to fast travel points, shops, side missions, and allies. Taking over outposts also reduces the enemy presence in the area and unlocks new skills and weapons. The best way to take over outposts is to scout them first with your camera or binoculars, mark all the enemies and alarms, and plan your approach. You can either go in guns blazing or sneak in undetected. The latter option gives you more XP and bonus rewards.
- Explore and climb radio towers. Radio towers are tall structures that you can climb to reveal more of the map and unlock free weapons at shops. Climbing radio towers also gives you XP and sometimes loot or relics. Exploring the island is also rewarding, as you can find collectibles, loot chests, letters, memory cards, and hidden locations. You can also encounter random events such as animal attacks, enemy patrols, or ally rescues.
- Don't worry about skill points. Skill points are used to unlock new abilities and perks that enhance your combat, survival, and crafting skills. You can earn skill points by completing missions, liberating outposts, finding relics, or killing enemies in various ways. However, you don't need to worry about spending them right away or choosing the best skills. You can unlock all the skills by the end of the game if you do enough activities and missions. You can also reset your skills at any time for a small fee if you want to try a different build.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that will help you play Far Cry 3 like a pro. There are many more things to discover and enjoy in this game, so don't be afraid to experiment and have fun.
