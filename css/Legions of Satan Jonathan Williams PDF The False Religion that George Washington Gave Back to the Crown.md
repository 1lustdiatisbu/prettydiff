# Legions of Satan: A Banned Book by Jonathan Williams
 
Legions of Satan is a book written by Jonathan Williams in 1784 that claims to reveal a secret conversation between General Cornwallis and General Washington at the end of the American Revolutionary War. According to Williams, Cornwallis told Washington that a "holy war" would begin on America and that the British Empire would eventually rule over it through a false religion and Freemasonry. The book also alleges that all religions would be infiltrated by Judaism and that the American people would unknowingly become loyal subjects to the Crown.
 
The book has been banned and suppressed by historians and authorities for its controversial and anti-Semitic content. It is considered to be a source of conspiracy theories and propaganda by critics. However, some people believe that the book contains hidden truths and warnings about the future of America and the world. The book is very rare and hard to find, but some copies have been digitized and uploaded online by archive.org. The PDF versions of the book can be accessed through the following links:

The book Legions of Satan is divided into two parts. The first part contains the alleged conversation between Cornwallis and Washington, as well as some commentary and analysis by Williams. The second part contains a series of letters written by Williams to various people, such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. In these letters, Williams expresses his views on the American Revolution, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, the French Revolution, and other topics. He also warns them about the dangers of Freemasonry and Judaism, and urges them to resist the British plot to enslave America.
 
The book is written in a style that is archaic and difficult to understand for modern readers. It also contains many references and quotations from obscure sources, such as ancient history, mythology, religion, and esoteric literature. The book is full of errors, contradictions, and exaggerations, and lacks any credible evidence or documentation to support its claims. The book is widely regarded as a hoax or a forgery by most scholars and historians, who doubt the authenticity and veracity of Williams and his sources. The book is also condemned as a hateful and inflammatory work that promotes anti-Semitism and anti-Masonry.
 
The book has been banned and censored by various governments and organizations throughout history. It has been accused of inciting violence and hatred against Jews and Masons, as well as undermining the legitimacy and authority of the American government and its founding fathers. The book has also been used by some extremist groups and individuals to justify their actions and beliefs, such as the Ku Klux Klan, the Nazis, the John Birch Society, and David Duke. The book is considered to be one of the most notorious and dangerous examples of conspiracy literature ever written.
